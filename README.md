# Movie_API
Application that allows the user to search for any movie that exists, and will post appropriate titles, years, and pictures of the movies. This application uses an API.

This code is partly based on Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2020" Udemy course, in which he talked in detail how APIs work and how to implement them in our
personal projects.
